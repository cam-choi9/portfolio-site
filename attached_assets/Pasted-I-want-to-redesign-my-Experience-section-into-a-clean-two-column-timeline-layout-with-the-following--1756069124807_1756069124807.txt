I want to redesign my Experience section into a clean two-column timeline layout with the following requirements:

Layout & Structure

Left Column: Timeline with team names + dates.

MDE (Mar 2025 – Present)

Connected Car (Dec 2024 – Feb 2025)

AI Hub (Jul 2024 – Nov 2024)

Software Validation (Nov 2022 – Jun 2024)

Next to each team, add a small ℹ️ info icon. When hovered, it shows a short tooltip:

MDE → Tests Galaxy–SmartThings compatibility for U.S. devices

Connected Car → Tests Android Auto & Bluetooth features across 40+ car kits

AI Hub → Develops AI-driven validation for Bixby and other LLM-powered tools

Software Validation → Validates Galaxy features across major U.S. carriers

Right Column: Four concise highlights, styled distinctly from the timeline:

Experience Highlights

QA System Design & Implementation — Designed and built the QA process for U.S. MDE testing, leveraging VOC insights, usage data, and protocol research to ensure Galaxy compatibility with the top 75% of SmartThings devices.

AI Integration in QA Workflows — Deployed AI-driven solutions like VOC classification and LLM‑optimized test case creation, accelerating analysis and standardizing prompt frameworks across the division.

Automation & Process Optimization — Streamlined testing workflows by optimizing 300+ Python automation scripts and building Excel Visual Basic systems for inventory and issue tracking, reducing manual effort and improving reporting.

Strategic Communication — Led vendor collaborations with Google, Ford, Toyota, and others to resolve compatibility issues faster, drive asset exchanges worth $100K+, and strengthen cross‑team partnerships.

Styling Requirements

Use a modern, AI-driven theme.

Left column (timeline) → muted, subtle background with simple typography.

Right column (highlights) → more vibrant colors, slightly larger fonts, better spacing.

Ensure the titles and contents look visually distinct.

Keep the layout fully responsive.

Skills Section

At the bottom, add a “Skills & Tools” section using bubble-style badges:
LLM · Python · Excel (Visual Basic & Macros) · Automation · AI-Powered Analysis · QA Strategy · Prompt Engineering · Data Analysis

Goal:
A visually clean, two-column experience section where the left timeline shows roles + dates, and the right side highlights my key contributions with distinct styling.
